            <h2>Are science and religion compatible?</h2>
            <p>This topic is delicate to me, as a physics teacher I need to answer
                this type of question and mediate discussions in class. <br/>
            In my childhood my mother, a religion person, introduced me to Christianity 
            and I followed this religion until my youth. Despite practicing Jesus´s 
            teachings in my life, I no longer follow the institution because I see many 
            contradictions inside the church.<br/>
            At the same time I started questioning religion, I was doing my degree in Physics. 
            In the first moment, these two concepts were incompatible for me, even though 
            I had noticed the most famous physicists believed in an existence of God, such 
            as Newton and Einstein.<br/>
            One day, my future master´s advisor in a subject called Elements and strategy 
            for teaching physics introduced me to a book called “The part and the whole” 
            by Nobel prize winner and physicist Wener Heisenberg. This book is an 
            autobiographical where Heisenberg remember meetings and conversations about 
            physics, music, philosophy, religion and politics. In one of these stories, 
            he recounts a discussion with Wolfgang Pauli and Paul Dirac about science and 
            religion and why some physicists believe in a conciliation. By this time, I 
            hadn´t ever seen a philosophical discussion about this theme.<br/>
            I Sympathize with Max Planck´s ideas. Science and religion are compatible 
            because they refer to a different realm of reality. Science is about the objective 
            material world, where it pushes us to make affirmations about reality and understand 
            their interconnections. While religion is about values, what we need to do you why 
            should it be this way. In other words, in science we are interested in discovering 
            what is true and false, while in religion is about what is good or bad, what has 
            value or not. <br/>
            The distinction of realm of reality is crucial because if we assume that these 
            belong to the same realm, we will have a problem between what science says and 
            the religion´s parables.
