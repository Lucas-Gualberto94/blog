            <p>This topic is delicate to me, as a physics teacher I need to answer
                this type of question and mediate discussions in class.

            <p>
            In my childhood my mother, one religion person, introduced me to Christianity 
            and I followed this religion until my youth. Despite practicing the JesusÂ´s 
            teachings in my life, I no longer follow the institution because I see many 
            contradictions inside the church.
