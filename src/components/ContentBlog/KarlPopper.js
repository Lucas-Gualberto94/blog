            <h2>Kar Popper Theory</h2>
            <p>Karl Popper (1902-1994) was an Austrian-British philosopher and academic. He is considered
                one of the greatest philosophers of science, having made a distinction between science
                (hard science) and pseudo-science (social science).

                He born in the 19th century and see Freud and Eistein doing science in a different way. Freud 
                became famous saying that childhood experiences would have a heavy bearing on who we grew up 
                to be, meanwhile Einstein made important discoveries about the behaviour of the light. While
                 Freud was looking backward, using past data to predict the present, Einstein was looking ahead,
                  trying to predict the future.
            </p>

            For Popper, methods like Freud only served to confirm beliefs. They could be used to prove anything. 
            It is easy to find confirmation of a theory if you are looking for it. For example, considering the 
            existence of Santa Claus, if you are looking for evidence that he exists, it´s is easy to find, presents 
            are under the tree on Christmas morning, songs, stories, movies and the guy at the mall. An example more
             realistic is the black swan theory, if you just see white swan, the pseudo-science can affirm that all 
             swan is white.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, for him, the only genuine test of a theory is one that is attempting to falsify it. Every Scientific 
            theory needs to be testable, refutable and falsifiable. You don’t seek to prove scientific hypotheses right,
             it´s the contrary.
