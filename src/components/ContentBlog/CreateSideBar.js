import React from "react";

const CreateSideBar = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Creating a sideBar using react</h2>
            <p>
                Use sideBar can help people navigate easily on your website or app. This allows you
                 to organize the contents of your page hierarchically.<br/>

                creating high level and customizable side navigation
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default CreateSideBar;
