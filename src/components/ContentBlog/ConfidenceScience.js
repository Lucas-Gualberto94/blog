            <h2>Why did people lose confidence in Science</h2>
            <p>After the Middle Ages and the dominion of Church over the world, emerged 
                um cultural movement called Enlightenment where the religious thought gave 
                way to reason. <br/>
            Ather that, Science became the principal source of knowledge accepted by society, 
            especially after 17th century when Isaac Newton in his work managed to join the 
            currents theories of motion and create a unified theory that could explain the 
            behavior of any type of objects visible on Earth, such as people, car, airplane, 
            (Galilei´s Theory) until big objects, such as planets and stars (Copernicus´s 
            Theory).  His work laid the foundation for scientific determinism – the idea that 
            science can determine with certainty the behavior of any physical phenomenon.<br/>
            This distrust in Science started when Newton´s Theory proved unable to explain the 
            behavior of very small objects, such as atoms, or objects whose speed is close to 
            the speed of light. This deterministic view of science just changed when quantic 
            phenomenon appears and was formulate Heisenberg´s uncertainty principle. In 
            microscopic world, the nature shows itself probabilistic.<br/>
            Nowadays we observe that growing up number of people don´t believe in Science and 
            its reliability. Distrust in a science that show itself as a probabilistic is one 
            of factors that people are losing your faith in Science. However, the biggest 
            problem is about science teaching, where  the science is showed as a absolute truth 
            and immutable, with concepts well defined, when actually is the opposite. When people 
            realized that Science is not how they learned it in school and scientist work with 
            models and this models don´t tell the absolute truth, they start questioning and 
            doubt about Science. It became evident with emergence of covid and distrust in what 
            scientists were saying and validity and efficacy of vaccines.<br/>
            Despite the fact that science is not deterministic, it is the best way to seek answers.
             Scientistic use the scientific method where every single idea undergoes testing and
              validation before being accepted.
