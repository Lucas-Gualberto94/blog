            <h2>Why did people lose confidence in Science</h2>
            <p>After the Middle Ages and the dominion of Church over the world, emerged 
                um cultural movement called Enlightenment where the religious thought gave 
                way to reason. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ather that, Science became the principal source of knowledge accepted by society, 
            especially after 17th century when Isaac Newton in his work managed to join the 
            currents theories of motion and create a unified theory that could explain the 
            behavior of any type of objects visible on Earth, such as people, car, airplane, 
            (Galilei´s Theory) until big objects, such as planets and stars (Copernicus´s 
            Theory).  His work laid the foundation for scientific determinism – the idea that 
            science can determine with certainty the behavior of any physical phenomenon.
